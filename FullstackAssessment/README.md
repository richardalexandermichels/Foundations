# Welcome to Assessment 00
Read the instructions below for more details on each problem and also how to start and submit your assessment. Good luck!

## Starting/Submission Instructions

### Starting

1. Before starting the test specs, make sure you hand in the written portion of your assessment first.
2. **Important:** Fork this repository to your own Github user account
3. Clone your forked repo to your local machine

This works just like the Test First JavaScript exercises that we've done - reverse engineer the test, write code to make the tests.

Complete these problems:

- 00_string_manipulation - 1.5 Points 
- 01_objects - 6 Points
- 02_reduce_right - 3 Points (+2.5 Extra Credit)
- 03_alternate_function_&_twice_function - 8 Points
- 05_createFunctions - 8 Points
- 06_argument_mapper - 8 Points
- 06_interleave - 2.5 Points 

Total Points: 37  



Just a reminder, **do not alter** any of the TestSpecs unless instructed to. ***All solutions should be written in the empty `.js` files in each folder***.

Each folder has a **README.md** file, **read the README files to get an overview of each Test Spec and Point Value.**

### Submitting

When time is complete or when you finish the code, commit the changes to the git repository using the command: `git commit -am "submitting assessment"` Then, do two things:

1. Push your repository back to your own personal fork of using `git push`. (this is required, .zip files will not be accepted).
2. Email a link to the FoundationsAssessment repository instructors+assessment@fullstackacademy.com.
